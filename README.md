This implementation of RothC simplifies its usage for carbon projects, especially ones under Verra's VM0042 methodology, by allowing for simultaneous runs in the project and baseline scenarios, while storing the results in a single output file.

- How to run the code: 
  Open up the command line, and type `python RothC_Py.py`
